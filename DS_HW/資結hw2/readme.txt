There is a file named maze.txt, which is the map we let rats to go.
Then we will output the roads to result.txt, including rat A and rat B.
the result is the position they are in the same time follow with ratA 
ratB ratA ratB.....if the maze is too eazy ,please change the map to maze.txt
with 0 is enable to go and 1 is the wall.
The program run with the ratA and store its roads in array at first.
Then we run with ratB and store its roads too.
finally,we output the results to the file by getting the information
from array.
Once a time from each of their array,until one of the array is empty.
Then output all the remaining datas in the other array.
Despite the fact that I done the homework,
this way waste too much space and time , and the code become longer.
That's a big problem of my program.
