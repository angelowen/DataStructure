The program is about the Josephus problem.
I was using the circular linklist to fulfill the result.
Firstly, you can enter the number to choose entering strings by yourself 
or reading from the file ,if you want to leave please press 0.
Then, any string is stored will be display on the screen and the 
total informations are listed at the bottom of the lines. 
Scondly, choose either right or left to kill from the linklist
and enter the skip number.
You can see the result including the list lengths 
and the string which is poped in diffferent moments
after all the steps was done.
finally, the last data will be listed at the bottom of the line.
