My name is 温彥博, and my student id number is 406410076,
For the homework 6, I implement four kinds of sorting algorithms to
make a unsorted array sorted from small to large, 
and the n data at the beginning will read by freopen from the test.txt
and test2.txt.
At the top of the output is the unsorted array read from the file and the 
sorted processes are printed as follows:
Selection Sort,Bubble sort,Insertion sort and Quick sort.
